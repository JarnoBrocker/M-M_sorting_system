# M&M sorter

## How to use
My main code is all in the directory 'main code'.
You can use my test codes for testing your hardware. 
A doxigen html page is created of the main code (NOT of the test code).

## Why this project
I needed a fun project to finish my propedeuse year on the Hogeschool Utrecht. After some thinking, I came up with this project. After some more thinking and some sketching, I finally choose this project.

## Used hardware
- Arduino DUE (to control everything)
-	color sensor (TCS34725)
-	7 servo’s (SG90)
-	OLED (mainly for testing, but also used in main code)
-	a button (same as the OLED: mainly for testing, but also used in main code)

## Info
