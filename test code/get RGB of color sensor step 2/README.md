# RGB of color sensor 2

## Used for
I noticed that some m&m's didnt got recognized, so I wrote this file. The only part this file is different from the file in my main code, is that some timings are longer. So you can investigate with this file why the colors aren't recognized.

## How to use
Just replace the main file in my main code with this main file.
